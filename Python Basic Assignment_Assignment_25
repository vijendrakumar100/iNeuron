1) What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses?
Enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets gives a list while enclosing a list comprehension in parentheses gives a generator expression.

2) What is the relationship between generators and iterators?
A python generator is an iterator

3) What are the signs that a function is a generator function?
If a function contains at least one yield statement, it is a generator function

4) What is the purpose of a yield statement?
yield statement can be used like the return statement in a function. When done so, the function instead of returning the output, returns a generator 
that can be iterated upon.

5) What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two.
- List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compared to map
- List comprehension allows filtering. In map, we have no such facility
- List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as map only returns a map object and does not return any list
- List comprehension is faster than map when we need to evaluate expressions that are too long or complicated to express
- Map is faster in case of calling an already defined function
