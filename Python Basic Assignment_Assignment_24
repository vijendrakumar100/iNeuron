1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?
As an expression, lambda returns a value that can optionally be assigned a name. 
In contrast, the def statement always assigns the new function to the name in the header, instead of returning is as a result. 
lambda's body is a single expression, not a block of statements
