1. What exactly is []?
Ans> [] represents an empty list

2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
Ans> spam[2] = 'hello'

Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.
3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?
Ans> 'd'

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
Ans> 'd'

5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
Ans> ['a', 'b']

Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True] for the next three questions.
6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
Ans> 1

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
Ans> It will append another element to the list bacon --> [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True, 99]

8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?
Ans> It will remove the the first occurance of the element 'cat' from the list bacon --> [3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
Ans> + is the list concatenation operator and * is the list replication operator

10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
Ans> append() adds an element at the end of a list while insert() allows us to add an element at any desired index position of a list

11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
Ans> We can remove items from a list using remove() and pop() methods

12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
Ans> a) We can concatenate two or more lists using the + operator, similar to string values
b) We can replicate a list using the * operator, similar to string values
c) We can slice the elements of a list using [] and mentioning the index position, similar to string values

13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?
Ans> Tuples are immutable whereas lists are mutable

14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
Ans> (42)

15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?
Ans>

16. Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?
Ans>

17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
Ans>
