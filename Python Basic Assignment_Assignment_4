6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
Ans> 1

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
Ans> It will append another element to the list bacon --> [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True, 99]

8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?
Ans> It will remove the 2 elements 'cat' from the list bacon --> [3.14, 11, True]
